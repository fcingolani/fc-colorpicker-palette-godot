# fc-colorpicker-palette-godot

This Godot addon lets you automatically set a color palette as the editor's ColorPicker presets.

![Sample ColorPicker](colorpicker-sample.jpeg?raw=true)

I've made this simple plugin as I got tired of copying and pasting the same hexacodes over and over again in many devices while editing a project.

## How to use it

After installing and enabling it you will find new Project Settings under "FC > ColorPicker Palette": "Colors" and "GPL File".

### GPL File

You can pick a GPL palette file from your filesystem. When opening your project, this palette file will be parsed and its colors will be used as ColorPicker presets.

### Colors

You can manually pick or input your colors. When opening your project, these colors will be used as ColorPicker presets.
